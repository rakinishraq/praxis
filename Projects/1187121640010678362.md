[Team Lotus >> #projects] POST 1187121640010678362: Concept: Clean no-login Discord UI 

Source Thread: [[1184898224557920286]]

## Post
Browse a Discord server with an ideation-centric UI (bot-based)

### Confirmed WebUI QoL features:
- a dedicated pinned message window
- first message of posts always visible instead of having to scroll to the top
- dedicated window for hyperlinks and image/video gallery
- toggleable windows for easy supplementary use

### Considerations:
- Sort hierarchy: reacts > # non-bot messages  > date
- WebUI-only comments section (goodmix)
- auto-regenerating server join link (goodmix)
- kanban/flowchart system
- edit bot-made post with command
- git version control on textfile posts
- binary space partition system
