## Post
Terriea Type Game
3D Figures in a "chess board" foramtion but the map instead of a checkers style map its a kingdom with a colorful  atmsphere, and like "The Game Of Life" candy style. And like chess there are two kingdoms. It is a 1v1 Or 2 v bot and your main objective is to  take down the other player/bot in a turn based game. You have to collect potions to buff your original towers or buy more cookie towers. With these towers you can control one to either heal, attack, shoot/ranged attack, buff/give more attributes to the cookie towers. When you control the cookie you are able to move it around with WASD, when you attack the other team you have to fight the enemy cookies by blocking and hitting back or shoot them from a far. The Castle will have a set amount of health. The way to stop the other players on killing the tower immediately when they killed the other players units is you only have 5 moves killing a cookie makes you lose one move moving forward one square makes u lose one move and finally attacking the tower makes you lose one move. All the towers are Ninja cookie allows to be steathy and get by other enemey cookies 50% of the times. The Archer cookie allows them to shoot arrows far away to not get hurt it self but each arrow takes one turn. The Squire cookie is your more genric type and has normal amount of hp nothing speical and is a melee type cookie. The Preist cookie allows towers to be healed if there in range each heal is one move and it can't attack. The Miner cookie allows them to get more currency for more cookies there will be gold ore respawning everywere it will take 3 moves to fully break. All the HP and DMG will be decided later. There is a merchent cookie which is were you buy all the cookies and potions aka buffs. How you get currency is from miner cookies. The starting cookie towers are 2 squire and 2 miners.
