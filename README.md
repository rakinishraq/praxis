- Theoretical full neuroplasticity would be negative as we could forget ourselves during a night of sleep
- Short-term plasticity includes caffeine or breathing technique to temporarily boost yourself with the expectation of reverting soon
- Long-term plasticity is useful for reflexive persistent changes and is the goal
- Focus and alertness are prerequisites (alert and not sleepy)
- Trigger during day, rewiring happens during non-deep and deep sleep
- Get sunlight during morning and potentially the afternoon to reduce grogginess
- Caffeine occupies the adenosine receptors and compete with sunlight so delay caffeine by two hours
- Creativity is best between slightly energized to drowsy alertness
- Many people find peak alertness three hours after wake useful for calculation/linear tasks
- Go/no-go circuit: Basal ganglia and cortex (forebrain: rational thought) reciprocal communication and facilitates action via dopamine (D1 receptor) and suppresses action via D2
- Learning involves go and no-go: suppressing action is important
- Three levels of alertness (autonomic arousal) have biases for go, no-go and both
	- Very high level of alertness biases towards go but less able to no-go
		- Remove phone and disable internet to stop bias for stimulating distraction
	- Sweet spot is where there's energy to go but not too much energy for no-go
- High-stress or very alert states benefit from silence and lower energy situations can benefit from background music
- Afternoon exercise prevents injury more but morning biases waking early and boosts morning alertness
- Andrew gets light on wakeup, delays coffee for two hours for 90min cognition-heavy learning period and balances too much energy by drinking salted water, generally gets exercise by first hour to three hours, meat salad nuts and fats for lunch instead of energy-draining hot foods, early afternoon low cognitive tasks, around 4pm hydrate non-sleep deep rest protocol then learning period more for 90min creative work
- Eating directs blood to gut lower alertness while fasting boosts
- Creativity has discovery mode for random abstract exploration via relaxed/sleepy mode and linear implementation mode for hard creations
	- Some Asperger's and autism forms boost linear mode
- Perfume ad by Spike has noteworthy creativity
- Psychedelics unlock natural sensory suppression and can cause synesthesia, which alone isn't creativity like commonly assumed
- They allow lateral communication in the brain which can inspire novel ideas, which can be creativity but not necessarily as novel ideas must be reconfigured to be interesting, stimulating and/or delightful
- In most cases, they don't help with linear implementation
- They will probably be more helpful in clinical contexts for mental health help
- Morning light advances and evening light recesses circadian rhythm to help consistency
- 10pm+ should be dimmed lights and no screens
- Evening meal is more carb-heavier (pasta, veges, etc.) with protein sometimes
- There's a peak of wakefulness an hour before bedtime useful for gathering resources in preparation for sleep which is normal
- It's normal to wake up briefly, look around and go back to sleep without remembering
