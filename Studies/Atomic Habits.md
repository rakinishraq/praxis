## INTRODUCTION

C1: The Surprising Power of Tiny Habits
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits.
Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.
Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

C2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
Ask yourself, Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?

C3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
(1) make it obvious (2) make it attractive (3) make it easy (4) make it satisfying
The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.


## 1. MAKE IT OBVIOUS

C4: The Man Who Didnt Look Right
To rate a particular habit, ask yourself: Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?
The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
(1.1) Habits Scorecard - start by making a list of your daily habits (and mark each +/-/= for positive/negative/neutral habit)

C5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
(1.2) Implementation intention - pair a new habit with a specific time and location. "I will (BEHAVIOR) at (TIME) in (LOCATION)."
(1.3) Habit stacking - identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. "After (CURRENT HABIT), I will (NEW HABIT)."

C6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
(1.4) Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.

C7: The Secret to Self-Control
Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one (thus unreliable).
(1.5) Make it invisible. Reduce exposure to the cue that causes the bad habit (remove it from your environment).


## 2. MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE

C8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible
It is the anticipation of a reward not the fulfillment of it that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
(2.1) Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

C9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
(2.2) Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.
If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

C10: How to Find and Fix The Cause of Your Bad Habits
Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.
(2.3) Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
(-2) Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.


## 3. MAKE IT EASY

C11: Walk Slowly, But Never Backward
Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.
The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.

C12: The Law of Least Effort
We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
(3.1) Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
(3.2) Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

C13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
(3.4) The Two-Minute Rule - When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
Decisive moments - choices that are like a fork in the road and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
(3.3) Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
Standardize before you optimize. You cant improve a habit that doesnt exist.

C14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
(3.5) Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases (to make habits easier and as commitment devices).
(-3) Make it difficult. Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.


## 4. MAKE IT SATISFYING

C15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
The first three laws of behavior change (make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy) increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.
The fourth law of behavior change make it satisfying increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.
(4.1) To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful even if its in a small way. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
(4.2) Make doing nothing enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.

C16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
(4.3) Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.
(4.4) Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.

C17: How an Accountability Partner Changes Everything
(-4) A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.


## CONCLUSION

C18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Dont)
Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
Play a game that favors your strengths. If you cant find a game that favors you, create one.
Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.

C19: The Goldilocks RuleHow to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

C20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits
The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
